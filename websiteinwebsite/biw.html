      <p>This is a website that sends a GET request and renders it on the page.<br /><br />It bypasses the same origin policy (currently) through <a href="https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/">cors-anywhere</a>.<br /><br />This means that you can view a website... within a website!</p>
      <p>Note that this is still experimental and many features are yet to be added.</p>
      <p>A lot of things still don't work. But hey, you can view Reddit.</p>
